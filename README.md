**Omdena AI Assistant for Civil Society**

This is an AI assistant that can be used by civil society organizations to help them with their work. The assistant is powered by a large language model (LLM) and can answer all sorts of user queries, such as:

How can I use AI to improve my organization's work?
What are the latest trends in AI for social good?
How can I collaborate with other civil society organizations to use AI?
How can I use AI to advocate for social change?
The assistant is still under development, but it is already learning new things every day. We hope that it will be a valuable tool for civil society organizations around the world.

How to use the assistant
